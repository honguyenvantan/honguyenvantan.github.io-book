Hi! Glad to see you here. I'm Tan. I created this site firstly for my personal note taking and now, I wanna share for you all stuff which I use for my study. And also I want to write my book for my study. I hope this will help me training my code skill and my english.

About me:
- Study in **Le Thanh Tong high school for the gifted**.
- Studied in **Vo Nhu Hung sencondary school** and **Phan Ngoc Nhan primary school**
- In next year, I will apply to The university of science in HCM. My major is Biotechnology. Hope I will get 6.5 score in IELTS in order to study abroad in 2 years later.
